- **Progressive Complexity** - Builds on Unit 01 foundation

### Dialogue Rules:
- 6-8 turns optimal (4 minimum, 12 maximum)
- Target vocab appears 2-4 times naturally
- Every turn has Uzbek translation
- Grammar shown in affirmative, negative, question forms
- Recycles Unit 01 pronouns, possessives, family words, greetings

### ⚠️ PREREQUISITE:
Students MUST complete Unit 01 (A1 Foundation) before this unit:
- ✅ TO BE affirmative (I am, You are, He is, She is, We are, They are)
- ✅ Basic yes/no questions (Are you...? Is he...?)
- ✅ Pronouns (I, you, he, she, we, they)
- ✅ Possessives (my, your, his, her)
