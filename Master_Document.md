## ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS (MANDATORY)

**These rules OVERRIDE all "creative freedom" statements elsewhere in this document. They are absolute requirements.**

### CONSTRAINT 1: CORE VOCABULARY COVERAGE (100% MANDATORY)

**ALL Core Vocabulary items listed for a unit MUST appear in dialogues/texts and vocab cards. No exceptions.**

- Every vocabulary item marked as "Core" in the unit specification MUST be taught
- If vocabulary cannot fit naturally into one dialogue, create additional dialogues or texts
- Vocabulary that doesn't fit a dialogue context → create a TEXT (monologue/description)
- The goal is 100% coverage of Core Vocabulary, not 70% or 80%

**Implementation:**
- First attempt: Fit all vocab into 1 dialogue (if semantically possible)
- If not possible: Create 1 dialogue + 1 text to cover remaining vocabulary
- If still not possible: Create 2 dialogues OR 1 dialogue + 2 texts
- Maximum: 2 dialogues + 1 text per lesson (only if absolutely necessary)

### CONSTRAINT 2: ANCHOR SENTENCE = DIALOGUE SENTENCE (MANDATORY)

**The Anchor Sentence in every Vocab Card MUST be extracted directly from a dialogue or text. It cannot be invented separately.**

- Anchor Sentence = Exact sentence from dialogue/text where target vocab appears
- If vocab appears multiple times in dialogue, choose the clearest/simplest instance
- The anchor sentence provides context - learners see it IN the dialogue first, then IN the vocab card
- This creates cognitive anchoring: vocabulary is always tied to a real conversational moment

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ Creating anchor sentences that don't exist in any dialogue
- ❌ Modifying dialogue sentences when copying to anchor
- ❌ Using anchor sentences that are paraphrased versions of dialogue

### CONSTRAINT 3: TARGET GRAMMAR IN ALL FORMS (MANDATORY)

**Every target grammar structure MUST appear in (+), (-), and (?) forms within the lesson's dialogues/texts.**

- Affirmative (+): At least 2 instances
- Negative (-): At least 1 instance
- Question (?): At least 1 instance
- These forms should be distributed across the dialogue naturally
- If one dialogue cannot accommodate all forms, the second dialogue/text must complete the cycle

### CONSTRAINT 4: RECYCLING THROUGH DIALOGUES (MANDATORY BALANCE)

**Recycling is MANDATORY. AI MUST balance vocabulary usage across dialogues.**

**📊 THE DIALOGUE-BASED RECYCLING PRINCIPLE:**

1. **Dialogues ARE the recycling vehicle** - Previous vocabulary appears through natural dialogue exposure
2. **AI balances exposure** - Prioritize LEAST-USED vocabulary to ensure even distribution
3. **Vocab cards teach TARGET only** - No recycling annotations or tracking in vocab card examples
4. **No escape clauses** - AI must exhaust options before skipping recycling

---

**🔄 AI RECYCLING ALGORITHM (REQUIRED STEPS):**

When constructing a new dialogue, AI MUST:

1. **SCAN** all previous dialogues and list vocabulary usage counts
2. **IDENTIFY** the bottom 20% (least-used vocabulary)
3. **INCLUDE** at least 3 words from this least-used pool in the new dialogue
4. **If a word doesn't fit** → try the NEXT least-used word (don't skip the requirement)
5. **Continue until** 3 least-used words are included OR you've tried all least-used words

---

**📊 MANDATORY QUOTAS:**

| Dialogue Content | Requirement |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Target vocabulary** | 100% of current unit's target words |
| **Least-used vocabulary** | Minimum 3 words from bottom 20% |
| **Foundation words** | Use freely (pronouns, TO BE, articles) |

---

**⚠️ NO EXCEPTIONS:**

- ❌ "Context doesn't allow" is NOT a valid excuse to skip recycling
- ❌ "It doesn't fit naturally" means TRY ANOTHER least-used word
- ✅ Keep trying until you find 3 that work
- ✅ Only if ALL least-used words have been tried and NONE fit → document why in the dialogue file

---

**📊 BALANCE THRESHOLD:**

| Condition | AI Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Vocabulary used < 60% of average** | HIGH priority - MUST include if any context allows |
| **Vocabulary used 60-100% of average** | MEDIUM priority - include naturally |
| **Vocabulary used > 100% of average** | LOW priority - already well-recycled |

**"Average"** = Total dialogue appearances ÷ Number of vocabulary items

**Once ALL vocabulary reaches ≥60% of average usage, the mandatory quota drops to 1 word minimum.**

---

**🎯 GOAL:**

By Unit 10, every taught vocabulary item should have appeared in dialogues at roughly similar frequency (±40% variance acceptable). This ensures:
- No vocabulary is "forgotten"
- No vocabulary is over-drilled
- Natural dialogue flow is preserved within mandatory constraints

### CONSTRAINT 5: VOCAB CARD STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

**Every vocab card MUST contain 6 content elements distributed across 6 slides (4+2 structure):**

**Core Content Elements (1-6):**
1. **Uzbek Context Question** (polarity/friction pattern) → Slide 1
2. **Uzbek Mirror Answer** → Slide 1
3. **Hybrid Answer** → Slide 1
4. **Anchor Sentence** (FROM dialogue - see Constraint 2) → Slide 3
5. **Example 2** (different subject/context) → Slide 3
6. **Example 3** (additional context or complexity) → Slide 3

**All examples must use ONLY vocabulary and grammar from current unit and prior units.**

**The 4+2 Slide Structure (6 slides total):** Every vocab card MUST contain Acts 1–4 (presentation, concept_check, drill_list, production) PLUS two mandatory additional slides (`discovery` after Act 2, `personalization` after Act 4):

| Slide | Phase | Type | Position | Status |
|-------|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Act 1 | presentation | flip card | Slide 1 | MANDATORY |
| Act 2 | practice | concept_check | Slide 2 | MANDATORY |
| **Discovery** | practice | discovery | After Act 2 | **MANDATORY** |
| Act 3 | practice | drill_list | Slide 4 | MANDATORY |
| Act 4 | production | input + trap | Slide 5 | MANDATORY |
| **Personalization** | production | personalization | After Act 4 | **MANDATORY** |

**Discovery Slide:** Bolds grammar tokens in a sentence and asks "Why was this form used?" with 2–3 multiple-choice options. Drives implicit grammar understanding through noticing, not explicit rule teaching.

**Personalization Slide:** Provides an Uzbek prompt for an open-ended personal response (e.g., "Sumkangizda nima bor?" / "What is in your bag?"). Uses `flexibleCheck` (Regex) to validate that target tokens are used in the response.

**Note:** Vocab card examples focus on teaching the TARGET vocabulary. Recycling happens through dialogue exposure, not vocab card annotations. Do NOT include `recycled_parts[]` or `recycledFrom` properties in vocab card data.

### CONSTRAINT 6: LESSON STRUCTURE & LIMITS (MANDATORY)

**Units must be divided into manageable pedagogical chunks (Lessons) based on cognitive load limits.**

- **Vocabulary Limit:** **Maximum 8 vocab cards** per lesson.
  - **Ideal Target:** 6 cards per lesson is the preferred pedagogical ideal.
  - If a unit has 20 words, split it into 3 lessons (e.g., 7-7-6 or 6-7-7), NOT 1 big lesson.
- **Thematic Division:** Lessons must be divided by **Semantic Category** and **Function**.
  - Lessons are not random splits; they are thematic sub-chapters.
  - *Example:* Unit 1 (Identity) → L1: Self/Name (Identity) → L2: Interaction (Greetings) → L3: Family (Relationships).
- **Collaborative Flow:** Lessons within a unit work collaboratively to build the unit's grammar function step-by-step.

---

## 🎯 HIERARCHY OF RULES

**When rules conflict, follow this priority:**

1. **NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS** (above) - Always win
2. **Grammar Accuracy** - Never use un-taught grammar
3. **Vocabulary Coverage** - All core vocab must appear
4. **Natural Language Quality** - Dialogues must sound human
5. **Creative Freedom** - Flexibility in HOW to achieve above goals

**Example Conflict Resolution:**
- If natural dialogue conflicts with vocabulary coverage → Create additional text to cover missing vocab
- If creative freedom conflicts with anchor sentence rule → Modify dialogue to include needed sentence
- If recycling balance conflicts with natural flow → Keep trying least-used words until you find ones that fit; AI will balance over subsequent units

**Rule Type Clarification:**
| Rule Type | Obedience Level | Meaning |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **CONSTRAINT (1-6)** | ABSOLUTE | No exceptions, no flexibility, no escape clauses |
| **RULE R (1-4)** | MANDATORY with guidance | Must follow the rule; AI has tactical flexibility in HOW |
| **RULE D (1-11)** | MANDATORY for structure | Format/structure required; style choices flexible |
| **RULE E (1-11)** | Flexible techniques | Teaching methods flexible WITHIN constraint boundaries |
| **MISSION FLOW** | MANDATORY | 3×2 Successive Mastery Cycle — Triple-Dialogue Loop |
| **CONTRASTIVE TURNS** | MANDATORY | Grammar Gap Solution — Discovery Popup after every dialogue |
| **GUIDELINE G (1-4)** | OBLIGATORY | Renderer enhancements, implementer discretion |

⚠️ **Flexible rules can NEVER override MANDATORY constraints.** If any "flexible" or "optional" guidance conflicts with CONSTRAINT 1-6, the CONSTRAINT wins.

## MISSION FLOW MODEL: THE 3×2 SUCCESSIVE MASTERY CYCLE (Sandwich Technique)

**Purpose:** This section defines the core lesson flow. Units are organized into **Missions**. Each Mission focuses on a single linguistic function (e.g., Existence, Possession) and follows a **Triple-Dialogue Loop** — three stages (Affirmative → Negative → Interrogative) where each dialogue is practiced twice for specific cognitive outcomes.

**Applies to:** ALL units U01–U10. No version gating.

**Cross-Reference:** This flow model interacts with CONSTRAINT 1 (vocab coverage), CONSTRAINT 2 (anchor sentences), CONSTRAINT 3 (grammar in +/-/?), CONSTRAINT 5 (card structure), CONSTRAINT 6 (lesson structure), and RULE D0 (dialogue quantity). The Triple-Dialogue maps to the existing L01/L02/L03 lesson structure — it does NOT create additional dialogues beyond D0's limits.

---

### STAGE 1: THE AFFIRMATIVE STAGE (Discovery & Mapping)

**Target:** Introduce 7–8 new target items in the **affirmative form**.

**Dialogue 1 (Production Enforcement):**
- Focus on building the initial schema.
- Target grammar sentences are presented in **English** or **Mirrored Uzbek** (see RULE E11: Syntactic Mirroring).
- Untaught "social filler" sentences remain in **natural Uzbek** to reduce cognitive load.
- Student clicks English target words to trigger the **4+2 Act Card popup** (Presentation → Concept Check → Discovery → Drill List → Production → Personalization).
- **Natural Flow Requirement:** If the affirmative dialogue requires a question or negative to maintain natural conversation flow, it MUST be included. However, only the target affirmative grammar is used for "flicking" to English. The question/negative filler remains in Uzbek (see RULE B below).

**Dialogue 1.1 (Linguistic Pressure):**
- The **exact same dialogue** is repeated.
- Text vanishes **800ms** after audio begins (`VANISHING_CUE_MS: 800`).
- A **2.0s response timer** forces proceduralization and stops the "translation loop" (`RESPONSE_DEADLINE: 2000`).

---

### STAGE 2: THE NEGATIVE STAGE (Cognitive Flexibility)

**Target:** Introduce 7–8 additional new items (Total Mission Vocab: ~14–16) OR recycle Stage 1 items using the **Negative form**.

**Dialogue 2 (Production Enforcement):**
- Requires the student to "flip" the logic established in Stage 1.
- Same Mirror Mode and 4+2 Act Card mechanics as Stage 1.

**Dialogue 2.1 (Linguistic Pressure):**
- Identical dialogue with text-fading and 2.0s response deadlines.

---

### STAGE 3: THE INTERROGATIVE STAGE (Abstract Integration)

**Target:** Final 7–8 new items introduced in the **Interrogative form**.

**Dialogue 3 (Production Enforcement):**
- Focus on question formulation. This is the most demanding stage, requiring the brain to shift to abstract syntactic representations.

**Dialogue 3.1 (Mastery Peak):**
- **100% English.** Final verification of automaticity without scaffolding or Mirror Mode assistance.
- Mirror Mode (🪞) is **DISABLED** in this stage to force internal mental mapping.

---

### MISSION FLOW RULES

**RULE A — Mandatory Progression:** Content MUST strictly follow the functional progression: **Affirmative → Negative → Interrogative**. No stage may be skipped or reordered.

**RULE B — Cognitive Load Management:** When a dialogue necessitates questions or negative forms FROM the unit's overall grammatical structure (for natural conversation flow), those sentences MUST be presented in **Uzbek** to reduce cognitive load. Only the target grammatical form for that stage is presented in English/Mirrored Uzbek.

**RULE C — Reactive Mirror Integration:** Rule B must work reactively and flexibly with the Mirror button (see RULE E11). The EN-UZ button allows switching between natural Uzbek, mirrored Uzbek, and original English states.

**RULE D — Working Memory Limits:** Each dialogue introduces a maximum of **7–8 new items**. If a mission request compromises this limit, the AI must proactively suggest a "Cognitive Reduction" — splitting content across additional stages.

**RULE E — Lexical Boost:** Use the same 7–8 verbs across all three stages of the Mission to maximize neural repetition signal. Grammar forms change (affirmative → negative → interrogative), but the core vocabulary remains consistent for deep encoding.

---

### LESSON-TO-MISSION MAPPING

The existing lesson structure maps directly to the Mission model:

| Lesson | Mission Stage | Grammar Form | Mirror Mode |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| L01 (+ dialogues) | Stage 1: Affirmative | (+) forms | ✅ Available |
| L02 (+ dialogues) | Stage 2: Negative | (-) forms | ✅ Available |
| L03 (+ dialogues) | Stage 3: Interrogative | (?) forms | ❌ Disabled |

**Clarification:** Dialogue 1/2/3 from the Mission model map to L01_D01, L02_D01, L03_D01 respectively. They are NOT additional dialogues but the existing per-lesson dialogues viewed through the Successive Mastery lens.

}
```

---

## THE GRAMMAR GAP SOLUTION: CONTRASTIVE TURNS (MANDATORY)

**Purpose:** Replace explicit grammar rule teaching with error-based, discovery-driven learning. Every dialogue (Stages 1–3) MUST conclude with a **Contrastive Turn Dialogue** and a **Discovery Popup**.

---

### THE CONTRASTIVE MECHANISM

A Contrastive Turn is a short 2-turn exchange between two characters that highlights a structural difference (e.g., singular vs. plural, present vs. past, affirmative vs. negative).

**Structure:**
```
Speaker A: [Sentence using FORM A]
Speaker B: [Sentence using FORM B — contrasting the key difference]

→ Discovery Popup appears automatically after the turn ends
```

**Examples:**

| Focus | Speaker A (Form A) | Speaker B (Form B) | Contrast |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Plurality | "Do you have a book?" | "No, I have three books." | a → three, book → books |
| 3rd Person | "They play football." | "He plays football." | play → plays |
| Tense | "I am tired." | "I was tired yesterday." | am → was |
| Negation | "I have a car." | "I don't have a car." | have → don't have |

---

### THE DISCOVERY POPUP VISUAL LOGIC (MANDATORY)

After the Contrastive Turn ends, a **Discovery Popup** overlay appears highlighting the linguistic contrast using a **high-contrast color scheme**:

**Color Rules:**

| Color | Label | Applied To | Examples |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| 🔵 **BLUE** | Form A (Base) | Singular nouns, base verbs, present tense | "a **book**", "they **play**", "I **am**" |
| 🔴 **RED** | Form B (Contrast) | Plural markers, 3rd-person -s, past forms | "three **books**", "he **plays**", "I **was**" |

**Critical Implementation Rules:**

1. **Marker-Level Precision:** Color must be applied specifically to the **morphological markers** (e.g., the "s" in "books" or "plays"), not the entire word, to draw attention to the suffixation.
   - ✅ `book` (blue) → `book<span class="red">s</span>` (red on the "s" only)
   - ✅ `play` (blue) → `play<span class="red">s</span>` (red on the "s" only)
   - ❌ `books` (all red) — too broad, doesn't isolate the change

2. **Whole-Word Exceptions:** When the entire word changes form (not just a suffix), color the whole word:
   - ✅ `<span class="blue">am</span>` → `<span class="red">was</span>` (whole word change)
   - ✅ `<span class="blue">have</span>` → `<span class="red">has</span>` (whole word change)
   - ✅ `<span class="blue">a</span>` → `<span class="red">three</span>` (determiner → quantifier)

3. **Side-by-Side Layout:** The popup displays Form A and Form B side by side or stacked:
   ```
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │         DISCOVERY POPUP                   │
   │                                           │
   │  🔵 "Do you have a book?"                │
   │  🔴 "No, I have three books."            │
   │                                           │
   │  🔵 a (singular)  →  🔴 three (plural)   │
   │  🔵 book          →  🔴 book[s]          │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Contrastive Turn Data Schema:**
   ```json
   {
     "contrastive_turn": {
       "stage": 1,
       "focus": "plurality",
       "speaker_a": { "text": "Do you have a book?", "speaker": "Ali" },
       "speaker_b": { "text": "No, I have three books.", "speaker": "Vali" },
       "highlights": [
         {
           "blue": { "text": "a", "type": "determiner" },
           "red": { "text": "three", "type": "quantifier" }
         },
         {
           "blue": { "text": "book", "type": "singular_noun" },
           "red": { "text": "books", "marker": "s", "type": "plural_noun" }
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

---

## RULE E11: SYNTACTIC MIRRORING (Mirror Mode) — MANDATORY

**Purpose:** Scaffold the transfer from SOV (Uzbek) to SVO (English) word order through visual reordering. This is the pedagogical core of the Mission flow.

**Classification:** MANDATORY — this is a core pedagogical rule, not a guideline.

---

### THE THREE-STATE SENTENCE LOGIC

Every target sentence in a Mission must support **three interactive states**, with the ability to switch back and forth freely:

| State | Button | Display | Description |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Natural** | 🇺🇿 UZ | Full natural Uzbek (SOV) | "Xonada o'ttizta kompyuter bor." |
| **Mirror** | 🪞 | Uzbek words in English SVO order | "[o'ttizta] computers [xonada]." |
| **English** | 🇬🇧 EN | Full English (SVO) | "There are thirty computers in the room." |

**Example Walkthrough:**

```
NATURAL (UZ):   "Xonada o'ttizta kompyuter bor."
                 (Room-in thirty computer exists)
                 ↕ click 🪞
MIRRORED:        "[o'ttizta] computers [xonada]."
                 (SOV words rearranged to SVO positions; target English words inserted)
                 ↕ click EN / complete 4+2 Act Card
ENGLISH:         "There are thirty computers in the room."
```

---

### THE EN-UZ NAVIGATION BUTTON (MANDATORY)

An **EN-UZ toggle button** MUST be introduced beside the Mirror icon (🪞) in the dialogue interface. This button allows students to switch between all three states at any time:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [🇺🇿 UZ]  [🪞 Mirror]  [🇬🇧 EN]           │
│                                              │
│  Current: "Xonada o'ttizta kompyuter bor."  │
│                                              │
│  Click 🪞 → "[o'ttizta] computers [xonada]" │
│  Click EN → "There are thirty computers..."  │
│  Click UZ → Back to natural Uzbek            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Navigation Rules:**
- UZ → Mirror → EN is the recommended progression
- Students can click any button at any time to jump to that state
- The Mirror button shows Uzbek structure words in brackets `[]` and English target words in normal text
- Clicking on a target English word in Mirror state triggers the **4+2 Act Card popup** for that word (6 slides total)

---

### MIRROR MODE IMPLEMENTATION RULES

1. **Natural Flow Requirement:** If an affirmative-stage dialogue requires a question or negative for natural flow, it MUST be included. However, only the **target grammar** (affirmative in Stage 1) is used for "flicking" to English. Non-target grammar filler stays in Uzbek.

2. **Variable Scaffolding:**
   - Mirror Mode (🪞) is **AVAILABLE** in Stages 1 & 2
   - Mirror Mode **MUST be DISABLED** in Stage 3 (Interrogative) to force internal mental mapping
   - In Stage 3.1 (Mastery Peak), the dialogue is 100% English — no Mirror support

3. **Data Requirement:** Each vocab card's `uz_mirror_answer` already provides the base Mirror form. Add an optional `syntax_scaffold` property to the presentation slide containing the fully rearranged Uzbek with English slots:
   ```json
   "syntax_scaffold": "[Mening xonamda] There are [o'ttizta kompyuterlar]"
   ```

4. **Target Word Isolation in Mirror State:** When the student flips a sentence from Uzbek to the Mirror state:
   - Only the **target vocabulary** appears in English
   - All other words remain in Uzbek but rearranged to English SVO word order
   - This creates a "bilingual bridge" that shows the student WHERE English words slot into the familiar Uzbek mental model

### MIRROR MODE INTERACTION WITH CARD POPUP

When a student clicks a target English word visible in Mirror state:

## SENTENCE FORM SCALABILITY TEMPLATE

**Purpose**: This is the master blueprint for assembling sentences across all 10 units. It shows how sentence complexity scales from atomic identity statements (Unit 1) to complex action frames with time/place/quantifiers (Unit 10).

**Cross-Reference:** This template directly interacts with the Recycling Rules section (RULE R1-R4). Each Level has corresponding Grammar Pattern References that define what can be recycled into later units.

**How to Use**: 
- For **Dialogue Writing**: Select the appropriate level based on target unit
- For **Vocab Card Examples**: Always use the highest available level for current unit
- For **AI Generation**: Use Logic Tags to identify sentence type
- For **Pedagogy**: Show students how sentences "grow" by adding slots
- For **Recycling**: Follow CONSTRAINT 4's AI-balanced algorithm (least-used 20% priority)

---

### LEVEL 1: Identity, State, Possession & Existence (The Foundation Engine)

**Units:** 01 (Identity + Possession + Existence), 04 (Past State), 09 (Materials)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** U01 Patterns F1-F5, U04 Patterns 1-5, U09 Patterns 1-5  
**Logic:** Foundational structures using linking verbs (be, have) and existence markers (there is/are). Subject can scale from simple pronoun to complex noun phrase.  
**Core Patterns:** 
- **TO BE:** `[Subject] + be + [State Chunk]`
- **HAVE/HAS:** `[Subject] + have/has + [Thing]`
- **THERE IS/ARE:** `There + is/are + [Thing]`

| Form | Formula (Skeleton) | Slot 1 (Subject) | Slot 2 (State/Thing) | AI Logic Tag | Unit Examples |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **(+) Identity/State** | `[S] + be + [State]` | I / My father / The boots | [Ali] / [a teacher] / [tired] / [leather] | `n_identity` `adj_state` | U01: I am Ali<br>U04: I was tired<br>U09: The boots are leather |
| **(+) Possession** | `[S] + have/has + [Thing]` | I / She / My father | [a book] / [a sister] / [a car] | `vp_possess` | U01: I have a book<br>U01: She has a brother |
| **(+) Existence** | `There + is/are + [Thing]` | There is / There are | [a book] / [two students] / [something] | `exist_affirm` | U01: There is a book<br>U08: There is something here |
| **(-) Negative** | `[S] + be + not + [State]` | She / The boots | [happy] / [leather] | `adj_state_neg` | U01: I am not Ali<br>U04: She wasn't tired |
| **(?) Question** | `Be + [S] + [State]?` | you / he / the boots | [happy] / [a teacher] / [cotton] | `state_q` | U01: Are you Ali?<br>U04: Was she tired? |

**Scalability Demonstration (U01 → U09):**
- **Identity (U01):** `[I] + am + [Ali]` — Simple identity
- **Possession (U01):** `[I] + have + [a book]` — Simple possession
- **Existence (U01):** `There is + [a book]` — Simple existence
- **State (U04):** `[I] + was + [tired yesterday]` — Past state + time
- **Complex Possession (U08):** `[I] + have + [nothing to do]` — Indefinite pronoun possession
- **Material (U09):** `[My new leather boots] + are + [made of Italian leather]` — Complex NP + detailed material

**Critical Grammar Rules:**
- **TO BE agreement:** I am / You are / He is / They are; Past: was (singular) / were (plural)
- **HAVE/HAS agreement:** I/You/We/They have / He/She/It has
- **THERE IS/ARE agreement:** There is (singular) / There are (plural)
- Material nouns can function as adjectives: "The boots are leather" (not "are leathered")

---

### LEVEL 2: Basic Action (The S-V-O Engine)

**Units:** 03 (Preferences), 05 (Past Regular), 07 (Past Irregular)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** U03 Patterns 1-3, U05 Patterns 1-4, U07 Patterns 1-4  
**Logic:** Introducing the Action Predicate. The "Object" is the scalable slot.  
**Core Pattern:** `[Subject] + [Action Verb] + [Object/Complement]`

| Form | Formula (Skeleton) | Slot 1 (Subject) | Slot 2 (Action VP) | AI Logic Tag | Unit Examples |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **(+) Affirmative** | `[S] + [Action Predicate]` | I / We / She | [like pizza] / [love music] / [played football] | `vp_preference` `vp_past_reg` | U03: I like pizza<br>U05: I played football<br>U07: I bought presents |
| **(-) Negative** | `[S] + [Aux] + not + [Base V]` | She / They / I | [doesn't like exams] / [don't love homework] / [didn't play] | `vp_neg_gen` `vp_neg_past` | U03: She doesn't like exams<br>U06: I didn't play football |
| **(?) Question** | `[Aux] + [S] + [Base V]...?` | you / she / they | [like pizza?] / [play football?] / [buy presents?] | `aux_q_gen` `aux_q_past` | U03: Do you like pizza?<br>U06: Did you play football? |

**Scalability Demonstration (U03 → U07):**
- **Simple Preference (U03):** `[I] + [like] + [pizza]` — Basic preference
- **Past Regular (U05):** `[I] + [played] + [football at school]` — Past + location
- **Past Irregular (U07):** `[I] + [bought] + [presents for the party yesterday]` — Irregular verb + purpose + time

**Critical Grammar Rules:**
- 3rd person singular present: like → likes, play → plays
- Past regular: play → played, work → worked (-ed ending)
- Past irregular: buy → bought, go → went, eat → ate (no pattern)
- Auxiliary "did" takes base verb (NOT "did played" ✗ → "did play" ✓)

---

### LEVEL 3: Expanded Action (The "Vaqt/Joy" Engine)

**Units:** 02 (Routine), 05 (Past Detail), 07 (Travel), 08 (Activities)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** U02 Patterns 1-9, U05 Patterns 3-4, U07 Pattern 5, U08 Patterns 3-4  
**Logic:** Time and Place slots are unlocked. These are **Mobile Chunks** (can move, but typically at end for A1).  
**Core Pattern:** `[Subject + Verb] + [Time/Place Chunk]`

| Form | Formula (Skeleton) | Slot 1 (Action Anchor) | Slot 2 (Vaqt/Joy Chunk) | AI Logic Tag | Unit Examples |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **(+) Affirmative** | `[S + V] + [Time/Place]` | I wake up / She works / I played | [at seven] / [in an office] / [yesterday] | `t_point` `t_habitual` | U02: I wake up at seven<br>U05: I worked at the office<br>U08: I play guitar every day |
| **(-) Negative** | `[S + Aux + V] + [Time/Place]` | I don't work / She doesn't play / I didn't go | [on weekends] / [after school] / [yesterday] | `t_general_neg` `t_past_neg` | U02: I don't work on weekends<br>U06: I didn't go yesterday |
| **(?) Question** | `[Aux + S + V] + [Time/Place]?` | Do you play / Did you go / Does she work | [after school?] / [yesterday?] / [every day?] | `t_leisure` `t_past_q` | U02: Do you play after school?<br>U06: Did you go yesterday? |

**Scalability Demonstration (U02 → U08):**
- **Simple Routine (U02):** `[I wake up] + [at seven]` — Action + precise time
- **Past Detail (U05):** `[I worked] + [at the office yesterday]` — Past + place + time
- **Activity Habit (U08):** `[I listen to music] + [in my room every night]` — Complex activity + place + frequency

**Critical Grammar Rules:**
- Time/Place chunks are **movable** but typically sentence-final in A1
- Multiple chunks follow order: Manner → Place → Time
  - "I worked [hard] [at the office] [yesterday]"
- Frequency adverbs (always, usually, often, sometimes, never) go before main verb:
  - "I always wake up at seven"

---

### LEVEL 4: Intransitive & Existence (The "There Is" Engine)

**Units:** 08 (Rooms/Activities)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** U08 Patterns 1-2 (Indefinite Pronouns + THERE IS/ARE)  
**Logic:** Subject becomes the scalable element. Switch from personal pronouns to **Indefinite Pronouns**.  
**Core Pattern:** `There + be + [Thing/Pronoun]`

| Form | Formula (Skeleton) | Slot 1 (Existential) | Slot 2 (Noun/Pronoun) | AI Logic Tag | Unit Examples |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **(+) Affirmative (something)** | `There is + [Thing]` | There is | [something] / [someone] / [a book] / [everything] | `pron_indef` `exist_affirm` | U08: There is something on the table<br>U08: Everyone is here |
| **(-) Negative (any-)** | `There isn't + [Thing]` | There isn't | [anything] / [anyone] / [a book] | `pron_neg_any` | U08: There isn't anyone here<br>U08: I don't have anything |
| **(+) Affirmative (no-)** | `There is + [No-Thing]` | There is | [nothing] / [no one] / [nowhere] | `pron_neg_no` | U08: There is nothing to do<br>U08: No one knows |

**Scalability Demonstration (U08):**
- **Basic Existence:** `There is + [a book]` — Simple noun
- **Indefinite Positive:** `There is + [something interesting]` — Indef pronoun + adjective
- **Indefinite Negative:** `There is + [nothing to do in the room]` — Indef pronoun + infinitive phrase
- **Complex Subject:** `Everyone in my family + likes pizza` — Indefinite pronoun as subject

**Critical Grammar Rules:**
- ⚠️ **NEVER use double negatives**: 
  - ✗ "There isn't nothing" → ✓ "There isn't anything" OR "There is nothing"
  - ✗ "I don't have no money" → ✓ "I don't have any money" OR "I have no money"
- Indefinite pronouns take **singular verbs**: 
  - everyone/everything/someone/something **is** (not "are")
- Pattern choice:
  - Use **any-** words with negative verb (isn't, don't, can't)
  - Use **no-** words with positive verb (is, have, can)

---

### LEVEL 5: The Noun Phrase Scalar (The "Descriptor" Engine)

**Units:** All Units (Progressive Complexity)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** NP complexity increases per unit - U01-U02 (Atom/Possessive), U03-U04 (Described), U09 (Material), U10 (Quantified + Full Complex)  
**Logic:** This is how we **scale the Subject or Object slots** themselves without changing the sentence skeleton.  
**Core Formula:** `[Determiner] + [Adjective(s)] + [Noun] = One Expandable Slot`

---

### LEVEL 6: Adverbial Phrase Progression (The "Context Expander" Engine)

**Units:** U02-U10 (Progressive Introduction)  
**Grammar Pattern Reference:** U02 Patterns 1-3 (Time), U06 Pattern 6 (Reason), U07 Pattern 5 (Manner), U09 Pattern 4 (Means), U10 Patterns 4-5 (Purpose/because of)  
**Logic:** Adverbials add contextual information to sentences - WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WITH WHOM, WHY, and FOR WHAT PURPOSE. Each unit progressively unlocks new adverbial types while recycling previous ones.

**Core Pattern:** `[Subject] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Adverbial Phrase(s)]`

#### Adverbial Types & Unit Introduction

| Adverbial Type | Structure | Introduced | Recycled From | Example |
|----------------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Time (WHEN)** | at/in/on + time | U02 | Foundation | "I wake up **at seven**" |
| **Frequency** | always/usually/often/sometimes/never | U02 | Foundation | "I **always** wake up early" |
| **Place (WHERE)** | at/in + location | U03 | U02 | "I like pizza **at home**" |
| **Direction (TO)** | to + place / home | U04 | U02-U03 | "I went **to the museum**" |
| **Company (WITH WHOM)** | with + person/pronoun | U05 | U02-U04 | "I played **with my friends**" |
| **Connectors** | and / but / or | U05 | Foundation | "I played **and** I was tired" |
| **Reason (WHY)** | because + simple sentence | U06 | U02-U05 | "I stayed home **because I was sick**" |
| **Manner (HOW)** | adverb (-ly) | U07 | U02-U06 | "I walked **slowly** to the park" |
| **Means (BY WHAT)** | by + transport / on foot / with + tool | U09 | U02-U08 | "I go to school **by bus**" |
| **Purpose (FOR WHAT)** | to + base verb | U10 | U02-U09 | "I bought boots **to wear at the party**" |
| **Reason (noun)** | because of + noun | U10 | U02-U09 | "I was late **because of the traffic**" |

#### Adverbial Slot Order (English Standard)

When multiple adverbials appear in a sentence, follow this order:
1. **Manner** (HOW) - slowly, quickly, carefully
2. **Place** (WHERE) - at home, in the park, to school
3. **Time** (WHEN) - yesterday, at seven, every day

**Example:** "I walked **slowly** [manner] **to the museum** [place] **yesterday** [time]"

#### Progressive Sentence Complexity by Unit

| Unit | Max Adverbial Complexity | Example Sentence |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|
| U02 | S + V + Time/Frequency | "I wake up at seven" |
| U03 | S + V + O + Place | "I like pizza at home" |
| U04 | S + V + Direction + Time | "I went to the park yesterday" |
| U05 | S + V + O + Company + Connector + S + V | "I played with friends and I was happy" |
| U06 | S + V + O + Time + because + S + V | "I didn't go yesterday because I was tired" |
| U07 | S + V + Manner + Direction + Time | "I walked slowly to school yesterday" |
| U08 | S + V + O + Place + Time | "I listen to music in my room every night" |
| U09 | S + V + Direction + Means + Time | "I go to school by bus every day" |
| U10 | S + V + O + Purpose + Reason | "I bought boots to wear because of the party" |

#### Adverbial Recycling Rules

**MANDATORY:** Once an adverbial type is introduced, it must be recycled in all subsequent units.

| Introduced In | Must Recycle In |
|--------------|-----------------|
| U02 (Time, Frequency) | U03, U04, U05, U06, U07, U08, U09, U10 |
| U03 (Place) | U04, U05, U06, U07, U08, U09, U10 |
| U04 (Direction) | U05, U06, U07, U08, U09, U10 |
| U05 (Company, Connectors) | U06, U07, U08, U09, U10 |
| U06 (Reason-because) | U07, U08, U09, U10 |
| U07 (Manner) | U08, U09, U10 |
| U09 (Means) | U10 |
| U10 (Purpose, because of) | Future units |

#### Critical Grammar Rules for Adverbials

**Connectors (U05+):**
- **and** = addition: "I played and I was tired" (both true)
- **but** = contrast: "I played but I wasn't tired" (unexpected)
- **or** = alternative: "Did you play or did you study?" (choice)

**Reason Clauses (U06+):**
- **because + sentence:** "I stayed home **because I was sick**" (full clause)
- **because of + noun:** "I was late **because of the traffic**" (noun phrase - U10)

**Purpose Infinitive (U10):**
- **to + base verb:** "I bought this **to wear** at the party"
- NOT "for to wear" ✗ - just "to wear" ✓

| Complexity Level | Formula Pattern | Example Progression | Units Introduced |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Atom** | `[Noun]` | Boots | U01-U02 |
| **Possessive** | `[Possessive Det] + [Noun]` | My boots | U01-U02 |
| **Described** | `[Poss Det] + [Adj] + [Noun]` | My red boots | U03-U04 |
| **Material** | `[Poss Det] + [Material] + [Noun]` | My leather boots | U09 |
| **Quantified** | `[Quantifier] + [Adj] + [Noun]` | A few new boots | U10 |
| **Full Complex** | `[Quant] + [Adj] + [Material] + [Noun] + [Prep Phrase]` | A few beautiful leather boots from Italy | U10 (Advanced) |

**Scalability Demonstration Across Units:**

| Unit | NP Example | Complete Sentence |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| U01 | `[Boots]` | Boots are here. |
| U02 | `[My boots]` | My boots are here. |
| U04 | `[My red boots]` | My red boots were dirty. |
| U09 | `[My new leather boots]` | My new leather boots are expensive. |
| U10 | `[A few pairs of leather boots]` | I bought a few pairs of leather boots. |

**Descriptor Slot Categories:**

| Slot Type | Options | Examples | Units |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Determiner** | a/an, the, my/your/his/her, this/that | a book, the book, my book, this book | U01-U02 |
| **Quantifier** | a few, a bit of, a lot of, some, many | a few books, a lot of money | U10 |
| **Adjective** | Color, Size, Opinion | red, big, beautiful, tired | U03-U04 |
| **Material** | Substance | leather, cotton, wool, plastic, metal | U09 |
| **Prepositional Phrase** | Location, Purpose, Origin | on the table, for the party, from Italy | U05-U10 |

**Rules for Descriptor Order (English):**
1. **Determiner/Quantifier** (the, my, a few)
2. **Opinion Adjective** (beautiful, ugly)
3. **Size** (big, small)
4. **Color** (red, blue)
5. **Material** (leather, wooden)
6. **Noun**
7. **Prepositional Phrase**

Example: `The beautiful big red leather boots from Italy`

### IMPLEMENTATION RULES FOR AI/DIALOGUE GENERATION

#### Rule 1: Always Identify Highest Available Level
- **Current Unit = 10?** → Must use Level 3 + Level 5 (Complex Action + Full NP)
- **Current Unit = 1?** → Limited to Level 1 (Identity only)
- **Review Cards:** Can use lower levels, but mark as "review" or "recycled"

#### Rule 2: Level Selection by Unit

| Units | Available Levels | Example Sentence Priority |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| U01 | Level 1 only | "I am Ali" / "My father is a teacher" |
| U02 | Level 1, 3 | "I wake up at seven" (prioritize Level 3) |
| U03 | Level 1, 2, 3 | "I like pizza" (prioritize Level 2) |
| U04 | Level 1 (past), 3 (past) | "I was tired yesterday" (Level 1 + time) |
| U05 | Level 2 (past), 3 (past) | "I played football at school" (Level 3) |
| U06 | Level 2 (neg/q), 3 (neg/q) | "Did you play football yesterday?" (Level 3 question) |
| U07 | Level 2 (irreg), 3 (irreg) | "I went to the museum yesterday" (Level 3 irregular) |
| U08 | Level 3, 4 | "There is nothing to do" (prioritize Level 4) |
| U09 | Level 1 (material), 5 (full) | "My new leather boots are expensive" (Level 1 + Level 5) |
| U10 | All levels, prioritize 5 | "I bought a few beautiful leather boots for the party" (Level 2 + Level 5 full) |

#### Rule 3: Complexity Scaling Within Same Unit
When generating multiple examples for same vocab item:
1. **First Example:** Use simplest available form (establish meaning)
2. **Second Example:** Add one complexity layer (time OR place)
3. **Third Example:** Use full complexity (time + place + descriptors)

Example for "like pizza" (U03):
- Basic: "I like pizza"
- +Frequency: "I like pizza every day"
- +Place+Time: "I like pizza at the restaurant on weekends"

#### Rule 4: Avoid Downward Regression
- ✗ Don't use "I am Ali" in Unit 10 unless it's explicit review
- ✓ Do use "I am tired" in Unit 10 if it's the target structure
- ✓ Always apply highest NP complexity available (Level 5) when possible

#### Rule 5: Logic Tag Usage
All generated sentences should include AI Logic Tag for:
- **Automatic categorization** in vocab card system
- **Grammar pattern recognition** for recycling
- **Difficulty scaling** for adaptive learning

Tag format: `{sentence: "I like pizza", logic_tag: "vp_preference", level: 2, unit: 3}`

## RECYCLING RULES (AI-Balanced Dialogue Recycling)

**Cross-Reference:** These rules work in conjunction with CONSTRAINT 4 (Mandatory Balance) and the Scalability Template (Levels 1-6).

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY RULE (APPLIES TO ALL RECYCLING):**
- ❌ NEVER use grammar from units not yet taught
- ❌ NEVER use vocabulary that requires untaught grammar structures
- ✅ ALL recycling must respect the teaching sequence

---

### RULE R1: Foundation Vocabulary (Natural Inclusion)

**These items appear naturally in most dialogues - no explicit tracking needed:**

| Category | Examples | Why Natural |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Subject Pronouns** | I, you, he, she, it, we, they | Can't make sentences without them |
| **TO BE Verbs** | am, is, are, was, were | Foundation of most A1 sentences |
| **Articles** | a, an, the | Appear in nearly every noun phrase |
| **Possessive Determiners** | my, your, his, her, our, their | Essential for identity/ownership |
| **Basic Prepositions** | in, on, at, to, from, with | Required for location/time expressions |
| **Question Words** | what, where, who, how, when, why | Required for any Q&A dialogue |

**AI Guidance:** These words don't need balancing - they appear naturally. Focus balancing efforts on CONTENT vocabulary (nouns, verbs, adjectives) from CONSTRAINT 4's algorithm.

---

### RULE R2: Progressive Complexity (Natural Growth)

**Vocabulary reappears in increasingly complex contexts as units progress.**

| Earlier Unit | Later Unit | Natural Progression |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| "I am tired" (U01) | "I was tired yesterday" (U04) | Same word, new tense |
| "I like pizza" (U03) | "Do you like pizza?" (U03+) | Same phrase, question form |
| "happy" (U01) | "She wasn't happy because..." (U06) | Same word, complex sentence |

**AI Guidance:** When recycling vocabulary, prefer using it in NEW grammatical contexts taught in the current unit. This reinforces both the old vocabulary and the new grammar.

---

### RULE R3: Forbidden Practices (ABSOLUTE)

**These rules have NO exceptions:**

**❌ NEVER DO:**
- ❌ Use grammar patterns from units not yet taught (always respect teaching sequence)
- ❌ Use vocabulary that requires untaught grammar (e.g., no "I have played" until perfect is taught)
- ❌ Over-recycle (>80% recycled content = no novelty for learners)
- ❌ Skip recycling quota because "it doesn't fit" (try next least-used word instead)

**✅ ALWAYS DO:**
- ✅ Check teaching sequence before using any structure
- ✅ Exhaust least-used vocabulary options before giving up on recycling quota
- ✅ Document in dialogue file if recycling quota cannot be met (with explanation)

**Examples:**
- ✅ Good: "Are you a teacher?" (U03 - recycles U01 vocabulary with taught question form)
- ✅ Good: "I was tired because I played football" (U06 - uses taught structures from U04 + U05 + U06)
- ❌ Bad: "I did play" (U03 - "did" auxiliary not taught yet in U03)
- ❌ Bad: "I have played" (any unit - present perfect not in A1 curriculum)

---

### RULE R4: Adverbial Complexity Limits

**Adverbials follow natural complexity progression by unit range:**

| Unit Range | Adverbial Limit | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **U02-U04** | ONE adverbial per sentence | "I play soccer at school" |
| **U05-U07** | Up to TWO adverbials | "I went to school with my friend" |
| **U08-U10** | Up to THREE adverbials | "I study hard at home every evening" |

**AI Guidance:** Once an adverbial type is taught, it can appear in any subsequent dialogue. Respect the complexity limits per unit range.

### Balance Check (AI Self-Verification)

After creating dialogues for a unit, AI MUST verify:
- [ ] All target vocabulary for current unit is included (100%)
- [ ] At least 3 words from least-used 20% are included (MANDATORY)
- [ ] No grammar from untaught units (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Adverbial count respects unit-range limits

### Success Criteria

By Unit 10:
- ✅ All vocabulary has been used in dialogues at roughly similar frequency (±40% variance)
- ✅ No vocabulary with zero dialogue appearances
- ✅ Natural dialogue flow maintained throughout

---

## DIALOGUE CREATING RULES (Constructing Natural Conversations)

**⚠️ VOCABULARY COVERAGE REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
ALL Core Vocabulary for the lesson MUST appear in dialogues/texts. If vocabulary cannot fit naturally into one dialogue, create additional dialogues or texts. See [Non-Negotiable Constraints](#-non-negotiable-constraints-mandatory).

**🎨 CREATIVE FREEDOM (within constraints):**
Within the mandatory vocabulary coverage requirement, the AI has freedom to:
- Create functional dialogues using current unit grammar and vocabulary
- Mix and match any previously taught language
- Choose turn length, dialogue type, and vocabulary combinations freely
- Determine HOW vocabulary appears, but NOT WHETHER it appears

**Purpose:** These rules explain how to construct natural, pedagogically effective dialogues that integrate target vocabulary, grammar, and recycling.

### Core Dialogue Principle
**"Every dialogue must teach target grammar/vocabulary through natural, contextual exchanges that follow real communication patterns"**

---

### RULE D0: Semantic-Based Dialogue Quantity (AUTHORITATIVE)

**This rule is MANDATORY and determines how many dialogues/texts are created per lesson.**

**Sandwich Integration Note:** Each lesson's dialogue serves triple duty: (1) initial comprehensible input, (2) anchor sentence source for vocab cards, (3) mastery target after card completion. No additional dialogues are needed for the Sandwich flow. The Triple-Dialogue from the Mission Flow Model maps to the existing L01/L02/L03 lesson structure.

#### Step 1: Semantic Category Assessment
Before writing any dialogue, identify:
- **Primary Semantic Category:** The overarching topic (e.g., Daily Routine, Sports, Food)
- **Sub-Semantic Categories:** Natural groupings within the vocabulary

#### Step 2: Sub-Semantic Grouping Principles
Sub-semantic categories are dictated BY the vocabulary type:

| Vocabulary Type | Sub-Semantic Axis | Grouping Examples |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Sports verbs/nouns** | Sport types | Team sports (football, basketball) vs Individual (swimming, running) |
| **Habits/Routines** | Temporal "WHEN" | Morning routine vs Evening routine; Weekday vs Weekend |
| **Food vocabulary** | Meal types/Categories | Breakfast foods vs Dinner foods; Drinks vs Solid food |
| **Place vocabulary** | Location types | Indoor vs Outdoor; Public vs Private |
| **Action verbs** | Action nature | Physical vs Mental; Fast vs Slow |

#### Step 3: Vocabulary Fit Test
**Critical Question:** Can ALL target vocabulary fit naturally into ONE grand semantic context?

- **✅ YES → Create 1 dialogue**
- **❌ NO → Create 2 pieces maximum (1 dialogue + 1 text/monologue)**

#### Step 4: Maximum Pieces Per Lesson (Vocabulary Coverage Override)

**Primary Goal: 100% Core Vocabulary Coverage**

| Pieces | Format | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | Dialogue | All vocab fits one semantic context naturally |
| **2** | Dialogue + Text | Vocab spans distant sub-semantics (e.g., morning routine + evening hobbies) |
| **3** | 2 Dialogues + Text | Large vocabulary set that cannot fit naturally in 2 pieces |

**Text Format:** A monologue or description talking about someone/something (not conversational)

**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE:** If vocabulary cannot fit into available pieces naturally, you MUST create additional pieces. Missing Core Vocabulary is NEVER acceptable. See [Non-Negotiable Constraints](#-non-negotiable-constraints-mandatory).

#### Step 5: Natural Language Constraint (Balanced with Coverage)
- ❌ **NEVER** force-stuff vocabulary unnaturally into a dialogue
- ❌ **NEVER** create robotic exchanges just to include all target words
- ✅ Humans don't talk like vocabulary lists — dialogues must sound REAL
- ✅ **BUT** if vocab doesn't fit naturally → Create additional dialogue or text (don't omit vocab)

**⚠️ Resolution:** Natural language quality is important, but vocabulary coverage is NON-NEGOTIABLE. If you cannot fit vocabulary naturally, create more pieces - don't skip vocabulary.

#### Step 6: Humanity Allowance
Dialogues CAN be slightly elongated to:
- Recycle vocabulary naturally from previous lessons
- Add conversational flow (reactions, follow-ups, transitions)
- Avoid mechanical Q&A ping-pong

#### Step 7: Decision Examples

| Lesson | Vocabulary | Semantic Assessment | Decision |
|--------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| U02_L01 | wake up, get dressed, clean teeth, have breakfast, leave house | All = morning routine (temporal sequence) | **1 dialogue** |
| U02_L02 | work, study, play, watch, read | Actions split: work/study vs play/watch/read (purpose) | **1 dialogue** (can group by "activities") OR **2 pieces** if forced |
| U03_L01 | like pizza, love music, hate exams, play football, watch TV | Preferences + activities = distant semantics | **2 pieces** (preferences dialogue + activities text) |

---

### RULE D1: Dialogue Structure Guidelines (Flexible)

**Suggested Structure (NOT rigid requirements):**

| Element | Minimum | Optimal | Maximum | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Turns** | 4 | 6-8 | 12 | One turn = one character speaks |
| **Target Vocab Instances** | 2 | 3-4 | 6 | Same vocab can repeat in different contexts |
| **Sentences per Turn** | 1 | 2-3 | 4 | Keep turns natural length |
| **Words per Turn** | 3 | 8-12 | 20 | Matches A1 processing capacity |
| **Speakers** | 2 | 2 | 3 | More than 3 = confusing for A1 |

---

### RULE D2: Natural Language Quality (Non-Negotiable)

**Dialogues must prioritize natural communication over vocabulary coverage.**

#### Core Principles:
1. **Authenticity First:** Dialogues must sound like real human conversations, not vocabulary exercises
2. **Context Over Coverage:** Better to use 70% of target vocab naturally than force 100% unnaturally
3. **Flow Over Lists:** Conversational flow and logical progression trump exhaustive word inclusion
4. **Real Reactions:** Include natural responses ("Really?", "That's great!", "Me too", etc.)
5. **Organic Recycling:** Previously learned vocabulary should appear naturally, not be forced

#### Quality Indicators:
✅ **Good Dialogue:**
- Uses target vocabulary in realistic contexts
- Includes natural conversation markers (transitions, reactions)
- Has logical turn-taking and topic development
- Feels like something A1 learners would actually say
- Recycles previous vocabulary appropriately

❌ **Poor Dialogue:**
- Lists vocabulary mechanically ("I like apples. I like bananas. I like oranges.")
- Ignores natural conversation flow for coverage
- Sounds robotic or unnatural
- Forces unrelated vocabulary into same conversation
- Repeats same structure monotonously

#### Implementation:
- Write dialogues as if teaching real students having real conversations
- Allow conversational elaboration even if it uses more recycled vocabulary
- Prioritize student engagement and usability over strict vocabulary quotas
- Remember: Students learn better from natural language models

---

### RULE D2: Turn-Taking Patterns

**Follow natural conversation flow:**

| Pattern Type | Structure | Example | When to Use |
|------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Question-Answer** | A: Question → B: Answer | A: Do you like pizza? B: Yes, I do. | Information seeking |
| **Statement-Response** | A: Statement → B: Reaction | A: I bought new boots. B: They're beautiful! | Sharing information |
| **Offer-Accept/Refuse** | A: Offer → B: Accept/Refuse | A: Want some coffee? B: Yes, please. | Suggestions/invitations |
| **Problem-Solution** | A: Problem → B: Suggestion | A: I'm tired. B: Go to bed early. | Advice-giving |

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- ❌ Monologue (one person speaks 3+ turns without response)
- ❌ Parallel conversations (A and B talk about different topics)
- ❌ Interrogation (A asks 5 questions in a row)

---

### RULE D3: Target Vocabulary Integration

**Distribution rules for target vocab in dialogue:**

1. **First Instance (Introduction):**
   - Must appear in clear, simple context
   - Preferably in statement, not question
   - Example: "I like to read magazines." (target: read magazines)

2. **Second Instance (Reinforcement):**
   - Different speaker OR same speaker, different context
   - Can be in question or negative
   - Example: "Do you read magazines every day?" (target: read magazines)

3. **Third Instance (Production):**
   - Most complex usage
   - Combined with other grammar/vocab
   - Example: "I read magazines at the library on weekends." (target: read magazines + time + place)

**Target Vocab Density:**
- 1 target item per 2-3 turns (not every turn)
- Space out repetitions (not consecutive turns)
- Mix with recycled vocabulary naturally

---

### RULE D4: Grammar Pattern Distribution

**Each dialogue must show target grammar in all three forms:**

| Form | Minimum Instances | Placement | Example (U06: did/didn't) |
|------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Affirmative (+)** | 1 | Early or middle | "I played football yesterday." |
| **Negative (-)** | 1 | Middle or late | "I didn't play tennis." |
| **Question (?)** | 1 | Can be first turn | "Did you play football?" |

**Pattern Variety:**
- Don't use same subject for all instances
- Vary time/place markers if present
- Show both short and long answers for questions

---

### RULE D5: Context Establishment

**Every dialogue must establish WSWW (Who, Situation, Where, When):**

1. **Who:** Identify speakers (names, relationships) in first 1-2 turns
2. **Situation:** What's happening? Why are they talking?
3. **Where:** Location (explicit or implicit)
4. **When:** Time frame (now, yesterday, routine, etc.)

**Establishment Methods:**

| Method | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Direct Statement** | "I'm at the shop." | Clear, simple |
| **Context Clues** | "Pass me the receipt." | Implies shopping context |
| **Question** | "Where are you?" "At home." | Natural info exchange |

**Bad Context:**
- ❌ No location/time clues ("I like it." "Me too." — Like what? Where?)
- ❌ Contradictory contexts (starts at school, suddenly at home)

---

### RULE D6: Natural Flow Requirements

**Dialogues must feel like real conversations:**

1. **Coherence:** Each turn must logically follow previous turn
   - ✅ A: "I'm tired." → B: "Go to bed early."
   - ❌ A: "I'm tired." → B: "I like pizza."

2. **Continuity:** Topic remains consistent or transitions naturally
   - ✅ Smooth transition: "I played football. After that, I went home."
   - ❌ Abrupt jump: "I played football. Cats are nice."

3. **Pragmatic Appropriateness:** Responses match social expectations
   - ✅ A: "Thanks!" → B: "You're welcome!"
   - ❌ A: "Thanks!" → B: "I have boots."

4. **Ellipsis (Natural Omissions):**
   - Use short answers: "Yes, I do." not "Yes, I like pizza."
   - Use pronouns: "It's mine." not "The jumper is mine."

---

### RULE D7: Uzbek Translation Requirements

**Every English dialogue turn must have Uzbek translation:**

| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Speaker Label** | Speaker: (English) / Spiker: (Uzbek) | A: / A: |
| **Translation** | Immediately after English turn | A: I like pizza.<br>A: Men pizzani yaxshi ko'raman. |
| **Target Vocab** | Bold in both languages | I like **pizza**<br>Men **pizzani** yaxshi ko'raman |

**Translation Rules:**
- Must be natural Uzbek, not word-for-word
- Maintain same level of formality
- Use appropriate Uzbek pronouns (sen vs siz)
- In addition to natural Uzbek translations, cards MAY include a `syntax_scaffold` mirrored Uzbek version for Syntactic Priming (see RULE E11: Syntactic Mirroring)

---

### RULE D8: Dialogue Complexity by Unit

**Adjust dialogue complexity to unit level:**

| Unit Range | Avg Words/Turn | Turns per Dialogue | Grammar Complexity | Example Topic |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **U01-U02** | 5-8 | 4-6 | Simple present, be verbs | "What's your name?" |
| **U03-U04** | 8-10 | 6-8 | Preferences, past state | "Do you like...?" |
| **U05-U07** | 10-12 | 6-8 | Past actions, questions | "What did you do?" |
| **U08-U10** | 10-15 | 8-10 | Complex NPs, quantifiers | "I bought a few..." |

---

### RULE D9: Forbidden Dialogue Practices

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use vocabulary not yet introduced (check unit progression)
- ❌ Use grammar patterns not yet taught (check unit grammar spine)
- ❌ Create "test-like" dialogues (A: question, B: answer, repeat)
- ❌ Force target vocab unnaturally ("The leather boots are leather")
- ❌ Mix multiple target structures in one turn (cognitive overload)
- ❌ Use cultural references unfamiliar to Uzbek A1 learners
- ❌ Include ambiguous pronouns (unclear antecedents)

---

### RULE D10: Dialogue Types by Function

**Choose dialogue type based on unit function:**

| Unit Function | Dialogue Type | Key Features | Example Opening |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Identity (U01)** | Introduction | Names, greetings | "Hi, I'm Ali. What's your name?" |
| **Routine (U02)** | Daily schedule | Time phrases, habits | "What time do you wake up?" |
| **Preferences (U03)** | Opinion exchange | Like/love/hate | "Do you like pizza?" |
| **Past Events (U04-U07)** | Storytelling | Sequencing, past time | "What did you do yesterday?" |
| **Description (U08-U09)** | Describing objects/places | Adjectives, locations | "My room has a red carpet." |
| **Transaction (U10)** | Shopping, asking | Quantities, prices | "How much is this?" |

---

### RULE D11: Quality Verification Checklist

**Before finalizing dialogue, verify:**

**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE CHECKS (Must Pass):**
- [ ] ⛔ **100% Core Vocabulary** included in dialogues/texts (create more pieces if needed)
- [ ] ⛔ **Anchor sentences** for all vocab cards exist in dialogues (exact match)
- [ ] ⛔ **All target grammar** shown in (+), (-), (?) forms
- [ ] ⛔ **No un-taught grammar/vocabulary** used (check unit progression)
- [ ] ⛔ **Recycling quota met** - At least 3 words from least-used 20% included

**✅ QUALITY CHECKS (Should Pass):**
- [ ] ✅ Target vocabulary appears 2-4 times each
- [ ] ✅ Recycling ratio approximately 60-70% (content words)
- [ ] ✅ Context (WSWW) clearly established
- [ ] ✅ Turns flow naturally and logically
- [ ] ✅ Uzbek translations accurate and natural
- [ ] ✅ Appropriate complexity for unit level
- [ ] ✅ Follows correct Scalability Template level

---

## EXAMPLE GENERATION METHODOLOGY

**⚠️ ANCHOR SENTENCE REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
The Anchor Sentence in every Vocab Card MUST be copied exactly from a dialogue or text. It cannot be invented separately. See [Non-Negotiable Constraints](#-non-negotiable-constraints-mandatory).

**🎨 CREATIVE FREEDOM (within constraints):**
Within the mandatory anchor sentence requirement, the AI engine can:
- Choose which exercise types to use (Jumble, Trap, Scratch, or none)
- Create examples in any format that targets current grammar and main vocabulary
- Mix and match patterns flexibly
- Recycle at word-level from any previously taught unit

**Purpose:** These patterns explain effective vocabulary and grammar teaching techniques, including Uzbek context questions, slot-substitution drills, and exercise types.

### Core Example Generation Principle
**"Every example must teach through natural contrast, contextual friction, and progressive complexity"**

---

### RULE E1: The Polarity/Friction Pattern (UZBEK QUESTION TECHNIQUE)

**Purpose:** Force learners to produce corrections, not just agreement. Creates cognitive engagement through contrast.

#### Pattern Structure:

```
UZBEK QUESTION (Wrong Assumption):  "Siz uyg'onasiz soat sakkizdami?"
                                     (Do you wake up at EIGHT?)
                                     ↓
UZBEK MIRROR ANSWER:                 "Yo'q, men uyg'onaman soat yettida."
                                     (No, I wake up at SEVEN.)
                                     ↓
HYBRID ANSWER:                       "Yo'q, men **wake up** soat yettida."
                                     (No, I **wake up** at seven.)
```

#### Implementation Rules:

| Element | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Uzbek Question** | Must contain WRONG information requiring correction | "Siz pizzani yomon ko'rasizmi?" (Do you hate pizza?) → Wrong assumption |
| **Uzbek Mirror** | Provides correct info in full Uzbek (SVO order) | "Yo'q, men pizzani yaxshi ko'raman." (No, I like pizza.) |
| **Hybrid Answer** | Same Uzbek structure with **English target** highlighted | "Yo'q, men **like pizza**." |

#### When to Use:

- ✅ Presentation phase (introducing new vocab/grammar)
- ✅ When target structure needs contrastive focus
- ✅ For dialogues requiring natural correction flow

#### When NOT to Use:

- ❌ In pure production exercises (learner generates freely)
- ❌ When simple affirmative statement is clearer
- ❌ In review/recycling contexts where pattern is mastered

---

### RULE E2: Slot-Substitution Drill Pattern (Teaching Reference)

**Purpose:** Vary only ONE element while keeping sentence frame fixed. Builds pattern mastery through controlled variation.

**Note:** This is a pedagogical pattern explanation. AI can use this approach OR create examples freely - whatever produces functional teaching material.

#### Pattern Structure:

```javascript
FIXED ANCHOR: "wake up at seven"    // The unchanging chunk
VARIABLE SLOT: [SUBJECT]            // The element that changes

Examples:
- [I] wake up at seven.              ← Base form (1st person)
- [She] wakes up at seven.           ← 3rd person variation
- [My sister] wakes up at seven.     ← Complex NP variation
```

#### Slot Types:

| Slot Name | What Varies | Fixed Elements | Example |
|-----------|------------|----------------|---------|
| `SUBJECT` | Subject NP only | Verb + complements | **I**/She/They play football |
| `SUBJECT_BE` | Subject + be form | Rest of predicate | **I am**/She is/They are tired |
| `OBJECT` | Object NP only | Subject + verb | I like **pizza**/music/books |
| `TIME` | Time expression | Subject + verb + object | I study **every day**/now/tomorrow |
| `PLACE` | Location phrase | Subject + verb + object | I work **at school**/home/office |

#### Example Set Construction:

For target "wake up at seven":

```markdown
**Anchor:** wake up at seven
**Slot:** SUBJECT

Practice Examples:
1. **I** wake up at seven.           [P1_TARGET - Base form]
2. **She** wakes up at seven.        [P2_VARIATION - 3rd person -s]
```

#### Rules for Slot Selection:

- Start with simplest variation (1st person singular)
- Move to 3rd person singular (shows -s rule)
- Add complex NP (recycled vocabulary from earlier units)
- Never vary more than one slot at a time

---

### RULE E3: Two-Tier Example System

**Purpose:** Show learners examples in order of complexity. Recycling happens in DIALOGUES, not vocab card examples.

#### Priority Levels:

| Priority | Label | Purpose | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **P1** | `P1_TARGET` | Primary teaching example (target vocabulary) | "I wake up at seven." |
| **P2** | `P2_VARIATION` | Pattern reinforcement (different subject/context) | "She wakes up at seven." |

**Note:** There is NO P3_RECYCLE tier. Vocab cards teach the TARGET vocabulary. Students absorb recycled vocabulary through dialogue exposure, not vocab card annotations.

#### Example Implementation:

```json
{
  "sentence": "**I** wake up at seven.",
  "subject": "I",
  "priority": "P1_TARGET",
  "grammarFocus": "present_simple",
  "complexity": 1
},
{
  "sentence": "**She** wakes up at seven.",
  "subject": "She",
  "priority": "P2_VARIATION",
  "grammarFocus": "third_person_s",
  "sentence_uz": "U soat yettida uyg'onadi.",
  "complexity": 2
}
```

#### Display Logic:

- **Low cognitive load context:** Show both P1 + P2 examples
- **High load:** Show P1 only

### RULE E5: Exercise Types (Optional Teaching Tools)

**Purpose:** These are REFERENCE exercise types for teaching. AI can use them, adapt them, or create alternatives.

**🎨 Creative Freedom:** Choose exercise types freely based on what best serves the teaching goal. These are patterns, not requirements.

---

#### Type 1: JUMBLE (Word/Chunk Ordering)

**Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "jumble",
  "data": ["I", "wake up", "at seven"],
  "correct_order": [0, 1, 2],
  "target": "I wake up at seven."
}
```

**When to Use (Optional):**
- Sentence structure practice
- Word order reinforcement
- Chunk recognition (is "wake up" one unit or two?)

**Display Example:**
```
Arrange the chunks in correct order:
┌─────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│  I  │ │wake up │ │at seven  │
└─────┘ └────────┘ └──────────┘
```

**Difficulty Levels:**
- Easy: 3-4 chunks, clear SVO
- Medium: 4-6 chunks, includes time/place
- Hard: 6+ chunks, multiple modifiers

---

#### Type 2: TRAP (Error Identification & Correction)

**Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "trap",
  "data": {
    "wrong": "She wake up at seven.",
    "error_type": "missing_third_person_s",
    "fix": "She wakes up at seven.",
    "explanation_uz": "U uchun 'wakes' (s bilan) kerak.",
    "explanation_en": "Third person needs -s"
  }
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Grammar rule reinforcement
- Common error prevention
- Critical thinking practice

**Display:**
```
Find and fix the mistake:
❌ "She wake up at seven."
      ↑
What's wrong? → [Missing -s for 3rd person]
✅ Correct: "She wakes up at seven."
```

**Common Error Types:**
- `missing_third_person_s`: She like → She likes
- `double_negative`: I don't have nothing → I don't have anything
- `wrong_tense`: I go yesterday → I went yesterday
- `be_verb_confusion`: I is → I am
- `word_order`: I at seven wake up → I wake up at seven

---

#### Type 3: SCRATCH (Progressive Reveal)

**Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "scratch",
  "data": ["I", "wake", "up", "at", "seven"],
  "reveal_order": "sequential",
  "hint": "Morning routine"
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Vocabulary recognition
- Reading comprehension
- Memory reinforcement

**Display:**
```
Tap to reveal the sentence:
┌───┐ ┌─────┐ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ ┌─────┐
│ ? │ │  ?  │ │? │ │? │ │  ?  │  ← Hidden
└───┘ └─────┘ └──┘ └──┘ └─────┘

After taps:
┌───┐ ┌─────┐ ┌──┐ ┌──┐ ┌─────┐
│ I │ │wake │ │up│ │at│ │seven│  ← Revealed
└───┘ └─────┘ └──┘ └──┘ └─────┘
```

**Reveal Strategies:**
- Sequential (left to right)
- Random
- Strategic (show function words first, content words last)

---

### RULE E6: Example Complexity Scaling

**Purpose:** Match example complexity to learner's current level and cognitive load capacity.

#### Complexity Levels:

| Level | Description | Sentence Length | Grammar Elements | Example |
|-------|-------------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **1** | Simple present, single subject | 4-6 words | S + V + (Time/Place) | I wake up at seven. |
| **2** | 3rd person or continuous | 5-8 words | S + V(s/ing) + (Adv) + (T/P) | She is reading now. |
| **3** | Tense contrast or negation | 6-10 words | S + Aux + V + Neg/Q + (T/P) | I don't work on weekends. |
| **4** | Past simple or complex NP | 7-12 words | S + V-ed/irreg + Complex NP + (T/P) | I bought new leather boots yesterday. |
| **5** | Multiple clauses or conditionals | 10+ words | S + V + (because/if/when) + S + V | I study English because I love languages. |

#### Progression Rules:

- Start every new structure at Level 1
- Move to Level 2 only after Level 1 mastery (80% accuracy)
- Levels 3-5 are for integration and review phases
- Never jump more than 1 level per example set

---

### RULE E7: Uzbek Translation Requirements for Examples

**Every example needs appropriate Uzbek support:**

| Example Priority | Uzbek Translation Required? | Format |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|
| **P1_TARGET** | ✅ Yes (always) | Full sentence: "Men soat yettida uyg'onaman." |
| **P2_VARIATION** | ✅ Yes (recommended) | Full sentence with note |

**Translation Quality Rules:**
- Must be natural Uzbek (not word-for-word)
- Follow SVO order to mirror English
- Use appropriate formality (sen vs siz)
- Highlight target chunks if needed: "Men **wake up** soat yettida."

---

### RULE E8: Example Set Minimum Requirements (Flexible Guidelines)

**⚠️ Operates WITHIN CONSTRAINT 5:** The mandatory vocab card structure (6 elements) from CONSTRAINT 5 is absolute. These ranges below are flexible guidance for HOW MANY additional examples beyond the minimum.

**For each target vocabulary/grammar item (suggested ranges, not rigid):**

| Phase | Minimum Examples | Maximum Examples | Distribution |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Presentation** | 1 | 2 | Polarity/friction context (optional) |
| **Practice** | 2 | 4 | P1_TARGET (1) + P2_VARIATION (1-3) |
| **Production** | 1 | 1 | Learner-generated |
| **Reproduction** | 1 | 1 | Canonical form |

**Total per item: 5-8 examples across all phases (flexible guideline)**

**Note:** AI can create more or fewer examples based on teaching needs. These are reference ranges, not requirements.

---

### RULE E9: Exercise Selection by Unit Level (Optional Guidance)

**Suggested exercise type alignment (AI can choose freely):**

| Unit Range | Suggested Primary Type | Suggested Secondary | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **U01-U02** | Jumble (3-4 chunks) | Scratch | Simple structure focus |
| **U03-U04** | Jumble (4-5 chunks) | Trap (simple errors) | Preference/past practice |
| **U05-U07** | Trap (tense errors) | Jumble (6+ chunks) | Past tense focus |
| **U08-U10** | All types | Mix freely | Complex structures |

**Creative Freedom:** Use any exercise type or combination that effectively teaches the target material.

---

### RULE E10: Quality Verification for Examples (Checklist Reference)

**These are quality indicators, not mandatory requirements. Use as a reference for effective teaching:**

- [ ] ✅ Polarity/friction pattern used in presentation (if beneficial)
- [ ] ✅ Slot-substitution shows variations (if using this pattern)
- [ ] ✅ Examples tagged with grammarFocus (helpful for tracking)
- [ ] ✅ Uzbek translations provided where helpful
- [ ] ✅ Complexity progression appropriate for unit
- [ ] ✅ Exercise type serves the teaching goal (if using exercises)
- [ ] ✅ Target vocabulary appears naturally (not forced)
- [ ] ✅ No un-taught grammar in examples
- [ ] ✅ Recycled vocabulary integrated naturally
- [ ] ✅ Examples align with Scalability Template level for current unit

**Remember:** These are quality indicators to guide effective teaching, not rigid constraints. The AI engine has full creative freedom to create functional, pedagogically sound dialogues.

## 🎯 END OF EXAMPLE GENERATION METHODOLOGY

---

## 🎯 END OF FOUNDATIONAL RULES

**Philosophy Reminder:**
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS** must always be satisfied first
- **Creative freedom applies to HOW** you achieve the constraints, not WHETHER to follow them
- **Core vocabulary coverage is mandatory** - create additional pieces if needed
- **Anchor sentences must come from dialogues** - no invented anchors
- **Focus:** Current unit grammar + main vocabulary + naturally recycled supporting language
- **U01 recycling:** Happens naturally - focus on complex peers (questions, extensions) in later units
- **Recycling:** Can occur at word-level; mix and match grammar from taught units freely
- **Mission Flow:** Triple-Dialogue maps to existing L01/L02/L03 structure (NOT creating new dialogues)
- **Mirror Mode (E11):** MANDATORY pedagogical rule; Vanishing Script / Thinking Pressure / Input Flood = OBLIGATORY guidelines
- **Discovery + Personalization slides:** MANDATORY additions to create the 4+2 structure (6 slides total), not replacements of Acts 1-4
- **Contrastive Turns:** MANDATORY after every dialogue — grammar gap solution via Discovery Popup
- **Applies to ALL units U01–U10** — no version gating

**Constraint Integrity Verification (Post-Update):**
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 1 (100% vocab coverage) — unchanged. Sandwich flow doesn't reduce vocab exposure.
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 2 (anchor = dialogue sentence) — unchanged. Cards still use exact dialogue anchors.
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 3 (grammar in +/-/?) — unchanged. Mission stages reinforce this per-lesson.
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 4 (recycling ratios 60-75%) — unchanged. No impact from flow changes.
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 5 — expanded additively. Discovery/Personalization create the 4+2 structure (6 slides total), not replacing Acts 1-4.
- ✅ CONSTRAINT 6 (max 8 cards/lesson) — unchanged.
- ✅ R1-R4 recycling rules — completely untouched.
- ✅ Scalability Levels 1-6 — completely untouched.

**Next Section:** Individual unit vocabulary and grammar details begin below, organized U01 → U10.

## RENDERER ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES (OBLIGATORY APPENDIX)

**Purpose:** These are implementation recommendations for the renderer (vocab_card_renderer_v2.js, dialogue renderer). They are NOT content-creation rules — no data changes are required. Implementers have full discretion on whether and how to adopt these enhancements.

**Classification:** OBLIGATORY (G1-G4), not mandatory rules.

---

### GUIDELINE G1: Vanishing Script Toggle

**Purpose:** Three display modes for dialogue view to progressively remove visual scaffolding.

| Mode | Display | CSS Class | Behavior |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Full** | Bilingual (English hero + Uzbek sub) | `.dialogue-full` | Default mode — all text visible |
| **Faded** | English appears on hover only | `.dialogue-faded` | Uzbek visible; English at `opacity: 0` → `opacity: 1` on hover |
| **Blind** | Uzbek-only meaning anchor | `.dialogue-blind` | English completely removed; student must produce from memory |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use CSS transitions: `opacity 0.3s ease-in-out` for smooth fading
- Toggle between modes via a 3-state button in the dialogue header
- This is a UI feature; no data schema changes required
- Store current mode preference in `localStorage`

---

### GUIDELINE G2: Thinking Pressure (Mastery Dialogue Only)

**Purpose:** In Stage 3.1 (Mastery Peak / Linguistic Pressure dialogues), force automaticity through time pressure.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `VANISHING_CUE_MS` | 800 | Text fades to 0% opacity after audio playback starts |
| `RESPONSE_DEADLINE` | 2000 | 2.0s timer for student to initiate production |

**Implementation Rules:**
- Applies ONLY to the final mastery pass (Dialogue X.1), NOT during initial learning
- If user fails to respond within `RESPONSE_DEADLINE`, the turn resets (no penalty, just retry)
- Targets the Basal Ganglia for stress-free retrieval under mild time pressure
- Text must move to `opacity: 0` (not `display: none`) to prevent Rote Reading
- Visual timer: progress bar that depletes over 2.0s

**Cognitive Rationale:** The 800ms vanishing window is calibrated to allow initial phonological encoding but prevent visual crutch-reading. The 2.0s response deadline creates productive struggle without anxiety.

---

### GUIDELINE G3: Grammar Input Flood

**Purpose:** Subtle visual highlighting of grammar patterns across dialogue turns to drive implicit noticing.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function highlightGrammarFocus(dialogueId, pattern) {
  // Wraps grammar focus matches in .grammar-flood spans
  // Uses existing grammar_focus property from unit metadata
  const dialogue = getDialogue(dialogueId);
  dialogue.lines.forEach(line => {
    if (pattern.test(line.line)) {
      line.line = line.line.replace(pattern, '<span class="grammar-flood">$&</span>');
    }
  });
}
```

**CSS:** `.grammar-flood { border-bottom: 2px dotted #4a90d9; }` — subtle underline, not heavy highlighting.

**Notes:**
- Uses the existing `grammar_focus` property from unit metadata
- Applied automatically during dialogue rendering
- Does NOT change the data; purely visual overlay

---

### GUIDELINE G4: Dialogue Mastery State Rendering

**Purpose:** Visual progression showing which dialogue lines the student has mastered.

**Implementation Logic:**
- When `mastered_lines[dialogue_id][line_index] = true` (tracked via `mastery_key` in localStorage):
  - Remove Uzbek subtext from that line
  - Remove click affordance (no more card popup trigger)
  - English text becomes sole visible content
  - Line gets `.mastered` CSS class with subtle green accent

**Visual Flow:**
```
BEFORE MASTERY:                          AFTER MASTERY:
┌────────────────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────────────┐
│ "I have three books."      │   →→→   │ "I have three books." ✅    │
│  Men uchta kitobim bor.    │          │                            │
│  [Click to learn]          │          │  (No Uzbek, no click)      │
└────────────────────────────┘          └────────────────────────────┘
```

**This drives the "Sandwich return" visual:** After completing all vocab cards for a dialogue, the student returns to see the dialogue with all mastered lines in clean English-only view, confirming fluency.
